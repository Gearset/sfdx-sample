# sfdx-sample

This is a sample defining the structure for a empty SalesforceDX project, you can use this as the basis for your own SFDX project.

To do this using Gearset:
1. Fork this repository (or just copy this folder) to your own source control provider.
2. Log in to [Gearset](https://app.gearset.com).
3. Configure a new comparison with an org or your existing Salesforce project as the source.
4. Set your new empty SFDX repository as the target.
5. After running the comparison, select what metadata you'd like to add.
6. Deploy your metadata.
